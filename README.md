# drum-thing

It's a kind of drum machine... thing. 

It generates random 16-step sequences of WAV samples, triggered from a SparkFun Wav Trigger board. An adafruit Neopixel Ring 16 provides an extremely flashy step indicator. There's a knob for tempo, another for (global) sample pitch, and buttons to generate a new random pattern or shuffle the existing one. 

In the future it's going to do more

NB: the above is out of date; it already does more
